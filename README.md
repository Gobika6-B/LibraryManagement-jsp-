Library Management System is a web-based application developed using Java, JSP, and Servlets to automate and manage the daily operations of a library. The system allows librarians to efficiently maintain book records, manage member details, and handle book issue and return processes through a user-friendly web interface.

The application performs core functions such as adding, updating, deleting, and searching books, as well as tracking book availability. It helps in maintaining accurate records of issued and returned books, reducing manual paperwork and improving overall efficiency.

This project demonstrates the implementation of Java web technologies, server-side processing, and CRUD operations, making it suitable as an academic project to understand JSP-based web application development.
